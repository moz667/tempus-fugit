# tempus-fugit

[Sed fugit interea, fugit irreparabile tempus](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempus_fugit)

The main idea of this mini-project is to have a graphic and painful memory that at 44 years old I have consumed a good part of my life.

To achieve this, we will introduce the date and draw a list of squares with the weeks that have elapsed since this date (marked in some way) and the remaining weeks until the 75th birthday is reached.
